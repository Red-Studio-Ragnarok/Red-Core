### Deprecation Warning

The method `RedLogger#printFramedError` has been renamed to `RedLogger#logFramedError`, all usages should be updated before 0.8.

## Red Core Version 0.5.1 Changelog - 2023-11-20

### Red Core MC

#### Changed

- Improved compatibility with older versions

#### Fixed

- Fixed version check
- Fixed mod not showing up in the mod menu in older versions

## Red Core Version 0.5 Changelog - 2023-11-17

### Highlight

Welcome to Red Core 0.5 an originally breaking release, but now it has a compatibility layer, all mods using it should update before 0.8 when the compatibility layer will be removed.

*Note: The compatibility layer is only for the MC (Minecraft) part of Red Core as normally it should only have been used there prior to 0.5*

#### The separation

Red Core and its Minecraft parts have been separated into two, this allows for greater freedom in how we develop Red Core, but also allows for Red Core to be used in any Java project.
Thanks to this separation, Red Core MC is now available for 1.7.10 through 1.12.2 meaning every version in between is compatible.

#### New GroupId

The old groupId was bad, and I did not own it, now both of these things are fixed by the brand new `dev.redstudio` which is more readable and sounds better, also I actually own it.

#### Re-Branding!
![Red Core Banner](https://github.com/Red-Studio-Ragnarok/Red-Core/assets/82710983/2cab5fb2-96dc-4738-83d2-907d5e835e2a)
Say welcome to the new Red Core branding! The Readme is also getting a makeover.

### Added

- Added an `Experimental` annotation
- Added a new experimental vector suite, this is supposed to replace the existing vector suite in 0.6 the existing vector suite is marked for removal in 0.8
- Added a compatibility layer for old groupId which is marked for removal in 0.8

### Changed

- `MathUtil` is now under `utils.math`
- Separated `MathUtil` clamping methods into their own class `ClampUtil`
- Changed GroupId from `io.redstudioragnarok` to `dev.redstudio`
- Made `RedLogger#RANDOM` private

### Removed

- Removed `Stopwatch` it wasn't that good or useful but was fun to make

### Fixed

- Fixed inconsistent argument naming in `MathUtil#lerp`

### Internal

- Switched to [gradle-buildconfig-plugin](https://github.com/gmazzo/gradle-buildconfig-plugin) entirely for project constants
- Switched to Gradle Kotlin DSL
- Switched to Adoptium
- General cleanup

- Moved `forceOptiFineFastRenderOff` from `RedCore` to `OptiNotFine`

## Red Core Version 0.4 Changelog - 2023-09-07

### Highlight

Welcome to Red Core 0.4 a non-breaking release that includes a lot of Quality of Life enhancements and general polishing of certain parts of Red Core.

Red Core 0.5 will be a breaking release since we will switch from `io.redstudioragnarok` to `dev.redstudio` stay tuned as dev builds will only be released for devs on GitHub as to not cause issue will mods prepare their updates.

#### Networking with Vectors just got a lot easier and cleaner too!

You now have `read` and `write` methods for all Vectors from Red Core, it simply take in `ByteBuf` and takes care of the rest.

- **Included [Jafama](https://github.com/jeffhain/jafama)**: A high-performance math library now incorporated within the Red Core, for better compatibility between mods.
- **Stopwatch Enhancements:** The Stopwatch feature now boasts the ability to output results directly to a file, in addition to averaging all these results for comprehensive analysis.

### Changed

- Renamed the `Chronometer` component to the more intuitive `Stopwatch` for improved user understanding.
